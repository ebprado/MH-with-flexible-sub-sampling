# Metropolis-Hastings with fast, flexible sub-sampling
Python scripts that can be used to reproduce the figures and tables presented in the paper "Metropolis-Hastings with fast, flexible sub-sampling" (Prado et al, 2024).

Some datasets used in the real-world applications can be found in the UCI machine learning repository, and the links are provided in the scripts. The datasets of road casualties can be downloaded from the R package "stats19" as shown in the corresponding script. Finally, the dataset of the US census is provided in this repository.
